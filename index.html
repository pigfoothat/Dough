                <p>When completed, the total weight of your dough will be approximately ${totalDoughWeight.toFixed(0)} grams, allowing you to make ${numPizzas.toFixed(0)} dough ball(s), each weighing around ${doughWeightPerPizza.toFixed(0)} grams.</p>
                <h3>Time:</h3>
                <p> This recipe take between 20 to 24 hours to complete. However, most of that time is spent just waiting for the dough to prove. you will only be busy for about 1.5 hours</P>
                <h3>Dough Ingredients:</h3>
                <li>Flour:     ${totalFlourWeight.toFixed(0)}g</li>
                <li>Water:     ${totalWaterWeight.toFixed(0)}g</li>
                <li>Yeast:     ${yeastWeight.toFixed(2)}g</li>
                <li>Sugar:     ${sugarWeight.toFixed(2)}g</li>
                <li>Salt:      ${saltWeight.toFixed(2)}g</li>
                <li>Oil:       ${oilWeight.toFixed(2)}g</li>
                <h3>Preferment Preparation:</h3>
                <p>To aid the proving stage, it is common to make a preferment 12 to 16 hours before mixing the main dough ingredients. Use equal parts of water and flour, and include all the yeast and sugar from the above list. Based on your input, use the following measurements:</p>
                <li>Flour: ${poolishFlourWeight.toFixed(0)}g</li>
                <li>Water: ${poolishWaterWeight.toFixed(0)}g</li>
                <li>Yeast: ${yeastWeight.toFixed(2)}g</li>
                <li>Sugar: ${sugarWeight.toFixed(2)}g</li>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Prepare the Preferment:
                <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ${poolishWaterWeight.toFixed(0)}g of water, ${poolishFlourWeight.toFixed(0)}g of flour, ${yeastWeight.toFixed(2)}g of instant yeast and ${sugarWeight.toFixed(2)}g of sugar.</li>
                <li>Mix thoroughly until there are no dry flour lumps. The consistency should be that of a thick batter.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl in plastic wrap with some air holes and a cloth.</li>
                <li>Let it ferment at room temperature for 2 hours, then...</li> 
                <li>Place it in the fridge for a further 10-14 hours, or until it is bubbly and has doubled in size.</li>
